# Telecom-Analysis

## Project Overview

In this project, I’ve been tasked with evaluating the potential acquisition of TellCo, a mobile service provider in the Republic of Pefkakia. My goal is to analyze telecommunication data provided by TellCo to uncover growth opportunities and determine the investment potential of the company.

Building on my previous success—where a detailed analysis identified a profitable niche for a delivery company, leading to a 25% increase in profits within six months—this project aims to deliver actionable insights that will guide the decision on whether to buy or sell TellCo.

The analysis will be presented through a user-friendly web-based dashboard and a comprehensive written report, providing clear recommendations based on the underlying data.

Feel free to explore the code and data to understand the methodologies used and the insights gained.
